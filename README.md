## The Odin Recipes Website

This project is an odin recipe website which is displaying recipes and showing the links to the details page of each recipe.

In this project I have used the skills for creating a boilerplate, using basic html elements and tags such as title, headings, paragraph, images, ordered and unordered lists, and so on.

You can find the live demo at: https://elpacificmb.github.io/odin-recipes

It is important to mention that this website uses only html without styling.
